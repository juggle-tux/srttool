NORIKO'S DINNER TABLE

2
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,730
December 2001

3
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,880
I tore off a thread that was
dangling from my coat.

4
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,350
I had run away from home.

5
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,680
I arrived at Tokyo Station.

6
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,530
Female, age 17.

7
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,450
Just a kid. That was me.

8
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:01,540
I carried my big bag pretending
I had just returned from a trip.

9
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,820
Walked to Ginza.

10
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,220
It was right before Christmas.

11
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,790
Bright with neon lights.

12
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,740
Everyone was better dressed than me,
and looked cool.

13
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,690
NORIKO

14
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,620
I had a father, a mother,
and a sister named Yuka.

15
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,140
I'm done.

16
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,650
Eat, Noriko.

17
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,650
When she has a problem,
she can't think of anything else.

18
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:30,700
I was 17. Junior in high school.
Always fighting with my father about college.

19
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,490
He wanted me to go to a local university,
but I didn't want to.

20
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,230
I knew it would be boring.

21
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:43,070
I wouldn't find a boyfriend
or even a friend there.

22
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:52,710
He peeled a tangerine
and put the peel in the ashtray.

23
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,320
Boys in Tokyo are worthless...and...

24
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,000
He hesitated to say.

25
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,030
But I knew. My cousins.

26
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,140
Sato and Kei got pregnant
while studying in Tokyo.

27
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,730
Taeko? Hello.

28
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,940
Sato and Kei just came by.

29
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:27,450
Dad thought,
girls go to Tokyo, get pregnant.

30
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,860
Boys are trouble...

31
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:39,960
I watched the neatly folded peel in the ashtray
slowly return to its original shape.

32
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,960
Tangerine, tangerine...

33
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,410
Orange-colored tangerine.

34
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,110
I had a friend named Tangerine
in elementary school.

35
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,950
I thought people called her that
because her cheeks were orange.

36
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,820
I had thought that...
But I was wrong.

37
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:11,400
One day, when I was with Yuka,
someone stopped me on the street.

38
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,400
Norippe?
Remember me?

39
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,270
It's me. Tangerine.

40
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,670
I didn't recognize her at first.
Tangerine, age 17.

41
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,540
What's up, Norippe?

42
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:33,650
No one called me that anymore.
My name's Noriko.

43
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,690
Do you know which school
this uniform is from?

44
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,250
Her uniform?

45
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:42,800
You have no idea, right?
'Cause it's my costume, actually.

46
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,430
It wasn't her school uniform.

47
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,370
She said that after junior high...

48
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:49,740
...she began working at an "image club"
dressing up and doing erotic things.

49
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,010
I'm handing out packets of tissues for work. Here.
...she began working at an "image club"
dressing up and doing erotic things.

50
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:54,580
I'm handing out packets of t issues for work. Here.

51
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,280
I'm handing out packets of t issues for work. Here.
"All-Girl Fantasy School"

52
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,940
I've heard of this place.
The "All-Girl Fantasy School," right?

53
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,190
That's the school I go to now.
And this is my route there.

54
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,350
That was the day I found out why she was
called Tangerine.

55
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,890
Okay, class. Who do you admire?

56
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,560
Mom and Dad.

57
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:22,970
In 2nd grade, the teacher asked,
"Who do you admire?"

58
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,170
Tangerine.

59
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,640
That's how I got my nickname.
You didn't know?

60
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,180
No.

61
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,880
I don't know why I said that.
Maybe I really liked tangerines.

62
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,220
She laughed loudly.
She looked happy.

63
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,820
Gotta go to work.

64
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,690
Nice seeing you.

65
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,760
Bye.

66
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,930
I still love tangerines.

67
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,860
She waved goodbye and left.

68
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:07,580
On our way home,
Yuka and I talked about our lives.

69
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,720
I was shocked that
Tangerine already had a job.

70
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,890
I admire Tangerine.
She's independent.

71
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,190
So am I.

72
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,720
You don't understand.

73
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,190
What?

74
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:33,040
Life as a woman.
Tangerine is really living.

75
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:41,310
All I did was skip class and read
novels intended for adult women.

76
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:47,380
Tangerine was so inspiring to me.

77
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,550
Idiot.

78
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,950
Yuka called me an idiot.

79
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,120
She's a whore.

80
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:59,130
You don't even like being a woman.
You wish you were a man.

81
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,330
All I'm saying is,
she's mature.

82
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:12,140
Are you saying that 'cause Dad is
always telling you to grow up?

83
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,740
Gotta go. Bye.

84
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,490
Adults...

85
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,590
My father was an adult...

86
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:37,700
He was a reporter for a local
newspaper called the Tiny Tokai Times.

87
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,100
It didn't matter if there was a war
abroad or massive earthquake

88
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,770
Come here!

89
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,110
Yeah, I'm coming.

90
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,910
- It was a deer?
- Yes.

91
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,450
they only reported local news...
Wild deer destroyed the rice field.

92
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,920
Ah, but today is a wonderful day.

93
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,880
"Deer Rampage Continues"

94
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,000
Trivial, local news.

95
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,630
"Shoppers Galore"

96
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,700
Great. Look this way. Okay, cheese.

97
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,640
"Cactus Park Breaks 4O Million Visitors"

98
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,310
"Cactus Park Breaks 4O Million Visitors"
Just peaceful stuff.

99
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,980
I love this town... and I love you and Yuka, too.

100
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,650
I love this town... and I love you and Yuka, too.
I had no interest in his work.

101
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,350
I love this town... and I love you and Yuka, too.

102
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,990
I love this town... and I love you and Yuka, too.
But I ended up writing
for the school newspaper.

103
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:33,020
But I ended up writing
for the school newspaper.

104
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,920
Published once a month.

105
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,910
I was editor-in-chief.
and always running around school.

106
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,170
Let's ask for more computer time.

107
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,080
Pleased to meet you.
This is our new reporter, Machida.

108
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,680
I thought Dad's paper was
too complacent.

109
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:10,720
So, by writing pieces opposed to school rules,
I felt I was rebelling against Dad.

110
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,530
For example, advocating unlimited
access to computers.

111
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:36,480
I think we should be able to
use the computers anytime we want.

112
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:45,050
'Cause if we could,
then we'd get much more...

113
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,490
...information.

114
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,640
I think we deserve that.

115
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,270
Yeah, but...

116
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,940
The rules must be changed.
We need information.

117
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:06,780
We only had one PC at home.
Definitely not enough.

118
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,950
I'm still using it.
Come back in 2 hours.

119
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,430
Cactus Park was fun, huh?
Let's go there again.

120
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,970
Noriko angry because she can't use
the computer. It's a scoop!

121
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,260
One more picture.

122
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,100
Let's take a picture together here.

123
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,770
Excuse me, would you mind?

124
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,340
Thank you.

125
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,250
Let's go over there.

126
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,860
I was a teenage girl stuck in the boondocks.

127
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:56,370
I wanted to talk to girls all over the country,
so I wanted to go online all the time.

128
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,910
Gotta get out of here.

129
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,710
Go somewhere different.

130
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,380
What?

131
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,020
I'm definitely going.

132
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,420
Am I crazy?

133
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,420
Whatever.

134
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:25,900
I wanted to go somewhere different,
but I didn't know where.

135
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,370
I wanted to go somewhere different,
but I didn't know where.

136
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:34,370
Stubborn, ditsy, rebellious, reckless.
I had to go forward.

137
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:42,550
After a while, the teacher decided
we could use the PCs until 5 PM.

138
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,380
What's the verdict?

139
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,280
Good news, we can grant your request.

140
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,920
Really?
Can I go use them now?

141
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:00,130
I had a favorite website.

142
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,730
A strange name...
It was called Haikyo. com.

143
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:10,240
There, 16- and 17-year-old girls talked
about school and life.

144
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:17,580
I quickly became a regular member.
My username - Mitsuko.

145
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,120
The name of French perfume.

146
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,490
When I became Mitsuko,
I was no longer a naive country girl.

147
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,720
And I made some friends.

148
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,590
Hello, Cripple #5.
I'm Mitsuko.

149
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,460
"To Mitsuko: Hello. "

150
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,240
Hello, Long Neck.

151
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,680
Hello, Midnight.

152
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,250
Hello, Broken Dam.

153
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,190
"To Mitsuko: Hello. "

154
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,870
And Ueno Station 54...

155
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,240
Hello, Ueno Station 54.

156
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,340
"To Mitsuko: Hello. "

157
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:26,850
Whenever Ueno Station 54 showed up,
It felt like we all became united.

158
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:33,390
It was like we were all standing on a
plucked guitar string.

159
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:39,660
And the conversation would begin.
Like a conversation in Morse code...

160
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm walking...
There's a plucked guitar string and...

161
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,870
I'm on top of it.

162
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:59,420
I was happy and surprised that
I found my best friends like this.

163
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,890
They were girls in Tokyo.
I had to go to Tokyo.

164
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,330
They were girls in Tokyo.
I had to go to Tokyo.

165
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,060
(Everything OK?)

166
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,530
But you haven't even met
Ueno in person.

167
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,540
As I was about to tell him
that I wouldn't get pregnant in Tokyo...

168
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:31,450
...to meet my friends...

169
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,620
The power went out.

170
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:44,360
Our house was very old.
The breaker switch would often go off.

171
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:50,000
No big deal.
Mom slowly got up.

172
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,870
Looks like the breaker has switched off.

173
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,100
Yuka came out of her room.

174
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,140
Turn the power back on, Dad.

175
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,020
Taeko, is everything all right?

176
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,220
The breaker isn't fixing it.

177
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,230
Dec. 10, 2001.
I had lived in Toyokawa for 17 years.

178
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:30,000
A cold winter night.
I was so cold and confused.

179
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,410
In the dark, I packed my bags.

180
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,110
Tokyo, Tokyo, Tokyo...

181
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:42,850
I had no idea what was in Tokyo,
but I decided to gamble.

182
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,420
I had to find out.
I had to gamble.

183
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:53,420
The important things in my room...
my diary, money, necklace, favorite shirt...

184
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,370
I looked for all the things I couldn't leave behind
What did I really need?

185
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,960
What is it?

186
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:06,110
I was born to breathe.
I wasn't breathing just because I was born.

187
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:12,650
I inhaled oxygen and exhaled
carbon dioxide. I felt alive.

188
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:20,930
I wanted to go somewhere different,
but I didn't know where.

189
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:29,590
Female, 17, ditsy, stubborn, rebellious.
Just a kid. That was me.

190
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,940
I just realized that I was a virgin.
Never even had a boyfriend.

191
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,040
Everything made me feel anxious.
Just everything. But I cherished the feeling...

192
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,880
I was worried about everything and nothing.
But I loved those worries.

193
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:54,760
Men, life, love, growing up...
Things were weird.

194
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,130
Life was weird.

195
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:04,260
I wanted to tackle something.
I had to go somewhere to find it.

196
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:14,480
I wanted to live, challenge, wish,
forget, learn, know, ask...

197
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:24,490
...see, stare, understand, hear,
listen, speak, meet...

198
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,820
...and be there.

199
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,020
I wanted to stand on with my own heart.
I wanted to walk on my own legs.

200
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,240
I had to talk to Ueno Station 54.
So I logged on to Haikyo. com.

201
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,540
I knew she'd be there.

202
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:55,480
www. haikyo. com

203
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,690
To the message board.

204
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,600
"Ueno Station 54?
It's Mitsuko. "

205
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,840
"I finally ran away from home
and came to Tokyo. "

206
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:27,950
"I'm at an internet cafe now.
I'll stay in a cheap hotel tonight. "

207
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:36,020
"Can we meet in person tomorrow?
I'm free all day. "

208
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:40,800
"Maybe I'll be free forever. "

209
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:48,810
"I've been pretending to be busy until now.
I feel naked. "

210
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:57,410
"Suddenly without restraint,
I feel kind of naked. "

211
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:05,750
"Like I'm walking around naked.
I'm a little self-conscious. "

212
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,320
"Today, I realized I'm still a virgin. "

213
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,500
"Maybe that's because
I feel naked now. "

214
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,120
I sound like any other girl.

215
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,790
Did I disappoint her?

216
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,490
We met online this past summer.

217
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:58,280
Ueno Station 54 had been a moderator
on this site for a long time.

218
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,740
- "To Mitsuko: How are you?"
- "To Ueno Station 54: Fine. "

219
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:10,020
She replied to all the messages
from girls crying for help.

220
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,280
Hello, I'm Mitsuko.

221
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,960
"Be strong, Mitsuko. "

222
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,100
"You can do it, Mitsuko! !"

223
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,470
"You can do it, Mitsuko! !"
I became Mitsuko and tried so hard
to be just like Ueno Station 54.

224
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,800
I became Mitsuko and tried so hard
to be just like Ueno Station 54.

225
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,070
"You have it hard, too"
I became Mitsuko and tried so hard
to be just like Ueno Station 54.

226
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:29,240
I became Mitsuko and tried so hard
to be just like Ueno Station 54.

227
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:38,250
I wondered. Could Noriko meet
Ueno Station 54 in person?

228
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,250
I realized that I wasn't Mitsuko.
Something obvious I just now realized.

229
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:51,160
I was afraid that Ueno Station 54
wouldn't want to meet me.

230
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,000
I received her reply.

231
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:11,340
She wrote
"I'll be at Ueno Station #54 at 11 AM. "

232
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:16,460
I went to Ueno right away.
Ueno at night was eerier than Ginza.

233
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,360
SHIMABARA

234
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,820
MITSUKO

235
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,930
I set my alarm for 9 AM.

236
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:14,640
I needed 2 hours to get ready.

237
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:20,810
Be ready emotionally, breakfast,
makeup...No, just to be ready emotionally.

238
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,790
I faded into darkness.
But I was ripe.

239
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,520
I was ripe for growth.

240
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:49,470
I didn't dream. But when I got up,
I felt like I was in a dream.

241
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,350
Being active, I was happy.

242
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,120
I was Mitsuko.

243
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:17,330
Once again, I tore off a thread
dangling from my coat.

244
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:23,210
I had left home...
and threw away that thread into the past.

245
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:43,000
I didn't know what
Ueno Station #54 meant.

246
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,900
Where is #54?

247
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,710
I don't know.

248
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,670
What's #54?

249
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,440
No idea. Sorry.

250
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,790
Almost 11 AM.
I walked around the station.

251
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:11,190
I should have left my luggage with the hotel.

252
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,040
1O5.

253
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,940
133.

254
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,850
9O.

255
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,020
84,79,7 4...

256
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,620
It's close.

257
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,500
54.

258
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:07,640
Ueno Station 54?

259
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,910
Mitsuko?

260
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,760
6 months later,
at Shinjuku Station...

261
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,520
That happened.

262
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:44,950
54 high school girls threw
themselves in front of a train.

263
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,850
They hide their inner selves.

264
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:50,960
According to the police press conference:
The 54 girls were...

265
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,570
"7:29 PM, Track 8"
According to the police press conference:
The 54 girls were...

266
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,060
According to the police press conference:
The 54 girls were...

267
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:58,500
Here is an eyewitness testimony.

268
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,810
What a tragic occurrence.

269
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,080
According to the police press conference:...

270
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:18,820
The 54 girls were not all from the same
high school. There are no suicide notes.

271
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,260
I t was horrible.
The platform was drenched in blood...

272
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,420
"54 Dead at Shinjuku"
I t was horrible.
The platform was drenched in blood...

273
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:44,280
I wanted to be silly.
Just like all my classmates.

274
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:53,090
Like all the girls my age,
I wanted to laugh loudly and be silly.

275
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:58,190
I hated crying.
I didn't wanna cry.

276
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,530
YUKA

277
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,200
Yuka, stop.

278
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,770
Thought I'd jump?

279
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,970
Just kidding.

280
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,110
Ever considered suicide?

281
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:13,980
No.

282
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,050
Maybe my sister killed herself.

283
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,350
Being silly.

284
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,390
You know the recent
mass suicide in Tokyo?

285
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,420
At Shinjuku?

286
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,750
I hear most victims
remain unidentified.

287
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,750
They're still trying to
separate the bodies.

288
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,470
54 total.

289
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,700
Hand in hand...One, two, three!

290
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,500
Hand in hand...One, two, three!
I hated being silly.

291
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,510
You sound amused.

292
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,610
But I couldn't help it.

293
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,810
They jumped so happily, right?
Maybe my sister was there.

294
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:55,880
No, she just ran away.
Probably with some guy.

295
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,880
You think so?

296
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,080
Yeah.

297
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:03,700
Maybe.

298
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,020
What, you want her dead?

299
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:11,260
I understand, Sis.
I know everything.

300
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:17,280
I know you're alive somewhere.
I hear your heartbeat.
You know how they managed to
meet at Shinjuku?

301
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,910
I know you're alive somewhere.
I hear your heartbeat.

302
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,850
I know you're alive somewhere.
I hear your heartbeat.
54 of them were from different
high schools.

303
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,370
54 of them were from different
high schools.

304
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,580
I know.

305
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,220
How?

306
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,550
It's a secret.

307
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,220
A secret?

308
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,060
And I know what it is.

309
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,100
Hey, common. Tell me, Yuka.

310
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,570
Wait, Yuka. Tell me!

311
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,480
Stop! Check this out.

312
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,810
What?

313
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,450
The red dots are women.
The white ones are men.

314
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,050
Stop.

315
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,780
Fine.

316
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,220
What's this?

317
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:17,640
The night before the mass suicide,
54 new red dots appeared.

318
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,500
It's a signal.

319
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,010
A signal? For suicide?

320
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,170
Yeah.

321
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,340
Or maybe a threat.

322
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,500
What's this?

323
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,950
Am I connected to myself, Sis?

324
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,590
"Are you connected to yourself?"
Am I connected to myself, Sis?

325
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,350
Ueno Station 54?

326
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,190
Mitsuko?

327
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,300
Hi, I'm Kumiko.

328
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,860
Nice to meet you.

329
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,710
You too.

330
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,340
This is my dad.

331
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,740
Hi, I'm Kumiko's father.

332
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,080
My mom.

333
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,680
I'm her mother.

334
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,320
I'm her brother.
Nice to meet you.

335
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,010
Let's go, Mitsuko.

336
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,500
Dec. 2001. I wrote this on Haikyo. com.
Are you listening, Yuka?

337
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,230
Dec. 2001. I wrote this on Haikyo. com.
Are you listening, Yuka?

338
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:34,350
"That day, I was suffering from PMS,
and rubbing my stomach. "

339
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:56,870
"I thought about my sister Yuka.
I knew she was worried about me. "

340
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:04,570
"We got in their van and drove to
Kumiko's grandmother's house. "

341
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,040
Grandma!

342
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:15,390
"Her grandma came out and
hugged Kumiko's brother. "

343
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:23,720
"The grandma and Kumiko's parents
hugged, too. She was moved. "

344
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:32,100
"When Kumiko said, 'Hi, Grandma,'
she started crying"

345
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:39,010
I wondered what Yuka would think
if she saw this.

346
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:44,140
I kind of thought she had been
posting on the board.

347
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:50,150
This girl "Yoko" sounded like Yuka.
Was it Yuka?

348
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,890
See ya.

349
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,980
Wait. Hey, wait up!

350
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:02,830
I wondered what she'd think
if she found out about me.

351
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,140
"Yuka, I'm good friends with
everyone on this site. "

352
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:56,920
"Surprised? We're both here now,
so be nice to me, 0K?"

353
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,220
"Understand, Yuka?"

354
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:05,190
"By the way,
are you connected to yourself?"

355
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:13,730
"I wrote about Ueno Station 54 before.
Ueno Station Locker #54. "

356
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:19,140
"When she decided to call herself
Ueno Station 54..."

357
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:23,880
"that's when it all began. "

358
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:27,750
I come here every night at 8
to check on my stuff.

359
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:41,960
Dad gave me this music box
for Christmas when I was 6.

360
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:47,530
"None of the stuff was actually hers. "

361
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,900
This pink dress is what my mom wore
To the hospital when my brother was born

362
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,740
Cute.

363
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,780
Yeah?

364
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,720
This is the harmonica I used during
Game Day in kindergarten.

365
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:06,880
"She just collected a bunch of stuff
that people had left behind. "

366
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:11,290
"And made up her own stories. "

367
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,330
These rain boots were the first things
I asked Mom to buy me.

368
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:26,100
But it didn't rain much,
so I wore them on a sunny day.

369
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:34,090
"She had no genuine memories.
She just didn't give a shit. "

370
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,920
You wanna put a memory in here?

371
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,690
Me?

372
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,030
This.

373
00:35:53,410 --> 00:36:00,640
"Ever since I met Kumiko,
I've been thinking that..."

374
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:08,720
"...she and I are similar. Maybe it means
I'm fabricating my past to become a new woman. "

375
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,520
"I'm no longer Noriko.
I'm Mitsuko, the new me. "

376
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,960
What's this?

377
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,160
Mitsuko's umbilical cord.

378
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:38,140
"I finally became the person
I always wanted to be. "

379
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,410
Okay, Mitsuko.
Your umbilical cord is here.

380
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:03,540
"Everything is our made-up story.
Isn't it wonderful, Yuka?"

381
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:06,270
"No End to Rash of Suicides"

382
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,280
Let's go.

383
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,440
Right.

384
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:12,010
The pomelos are doing well this year.

385
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,240
- What about damage from the birds?
- Well...

386
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,180
Tetsu, take a picture. please.

387
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,890
Okay.

388
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,080
I decided to become Yoko,
and be connected to myself.

389
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:14,070
I decided to become Yoko,
and be connected to myself.

390
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:19,440
A clue for Dad.
I wondered if he'd notice.

391
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,820
Free tissues.

392
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:59,220
I kept hearing my sister's voice,
like a radio that wouldn't turn off.

393
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:04,190
My sister's voice...

394
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,230
Taeko. Taeko...

395
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:24,810
Dad was shocked that
I followed in my sister's footsteps.

396
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,490
Where are you?

397
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:36,220
It was a month after I ran away...

398
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:43,860
...that Dad finally started
looking thoroughly for clues.

399
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,370
"Daddy"

400
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,440
He quit his job right after I left.

401
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,050
Listen...

402
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,450
I quit.

403
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:12,090
For a few weeks, he had searched
for me and my sister.

404
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,890
But he lacked
any understanding of us.

405
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:25,540
Finally, he started looking for
clues in our room...

406
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:31,680
I stopped writing right there.
I was in class.

407
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:41,920
I was just thinking if I ran away
like my sister, what would my father, Tetsuzo, do?

408
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:47,060
What would he do?

409
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:55,500
How would he know anything about us?
The clue I had left for him?

410
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:05,350
My father, Tetsuzo, would find it accidentally
behind that poster in our room.

411
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,680
"Yuka's handwriting, "
he'd think.

412
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,250
"Ueno Station 54 Haikyo"

413
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:18,790
A month later, Tetsuzo's wife Taeko
started to help him.

414
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:27,300
They searched their daughters' room
and obtained pieces of information.

415
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:35,210
They checked every website
that their daughters had visited.

416
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:40,540
"1. Noriko was friends with
a woman named Ueno Station 54. "

417
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:46,150
"2. Ueno Station 54 meant
the locker #54 at Ueno Station. "

418
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:51,730
Tetsuzo, a former reporter,
knew what he was doing.

419
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:59,830
Meanwhile, he stopped sharing
information with his wife.

420
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,000
- What's wrong?

421
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,140
- Nothing.

422
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:11,080
He thought it would be like saying
he knew where an alien base was.

423
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:17,920
Like saying aliens had
abducted Yuka and Noriko.

424
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:26,890
There was no way
he would say anything.

425
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:40,510
He became more and more convinced
that his supposition was correct.

426
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:47,350
He was afraid. It would be wading into
an unbelievably large amount of magma.

427
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:53,950
He was sure that his wife would
ridicule him if he told her.

428
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:09,270
"Suicide Club Exists." The tabloid
headline matched his conclusion.

429
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:14,040
He knew the Suicide Club existed.

430
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:19,910
He had been fooling himself that...

431
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:24,810
...Toyokawa was some kind of paradise,
apart from the dangers of the world.

432
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:32,160
Simple Toyokawa had become a bleeding corpse.

433
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:35,500
Because of the Suicide Club?

434
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:43,840
"What's your connection to you,
and to your family?"

435
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:52,250
"How are you connected to yourself?"
Tetsuzo felt the club was asking him.

436
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,190
Dec. 11, 2002.

437
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:03,690
After 3 months of investigation,
he wrote the following

438
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,030
"1. The Suicide Club exists. "

439
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,200
"2. Members meet on Haikyo.com"

440
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:22,510
"3. The dots onHaikyo.com
represent suicides. "

441
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:30,110
"The white ones are men.
The red ones are women. "

442
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,330
What was I writing?

443
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,880
Where's Tangerine?

444
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:01,410
I don't know.

445
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:11,520
On to the last scene.
This is where the trouble begins.

446
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,100
What has the power to get the magma flowing?

447
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,760
Tetsuzo tried to speculate...

448
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:27,380
But he told himself to
look only at the facts.

449
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:35,380
He wrote so hard that he could see
his writing on the next page.

450
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:38,290
Wait...

451
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:57,110
What if I tore this page from
my notebook and went to Tokyo...

452
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:03,150
Who would shade my blank pages
with a pencil to discover what I wrote?

453
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:12,920
I managed to reach my sister's heart.
Would Dad reach mine?

454
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:27,570
Nobody would care about my imprint.
People vanish all the time.

455
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,900
A beautiful day in Toyokawa...

456
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:39,670
That was the last time
I saw the ocean.

457
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:45,650
And the last time
I watched the sunset there.

458
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,750
KUMIKO

459
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:55,290
What's wrong?

460
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,230
Nothing.

461
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,030
PMS?

462
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:06,110
Kumiko...Ueno Station?

463
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:08,040
Call me Ueno Station if you want.

464
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,550
Real name?

465
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,060
Here.

466
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:28,030
Hello.

467
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,740
Grandma, it's been so long.

468
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:40,670
The first day, we went to
Kumiko's grandma's house.

469
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,650
I'm almost done with elementary school.

470
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:48,910
Good for you.
Maybe I should give you a gift.

471
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:58,930
I wasn't related to them at all,
but I was there...

472
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:02,600
...and it was cozy.

473
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:14,610
They were the epitome of happiness.
It was so great to see them.

474
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:23,580
I had lived as a member of the
Shimabara family for 17 years.

475
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:30,890
But we had been cold and distant.

476
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:35,060
The bonds holding Kumiko's family together
were like fat pipes.

477
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:39,740
Each relationship an artery of happiness
for them.

478
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,770
Kumiko's happy family.

479
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,810
I wanted so badly to be
a member of this family.

480
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,310
We'll visit again.

481
00:48:55,750 --> 00:49:00,850
We waved and said goodbye to Grandma...

482
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:06,620
...and then left for another
grandmother's house.

483
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,590
Come on, Mitsuko.

484
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:09,290
The other grandmother also
gave us a hearty welcome.

485
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,120
How are you?

486
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:17,130
They greeted each other.

487
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:21,030
This time I wasn't so nervous for some reason.

488
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:24,270
The conversation went on exactly
as at the last house.

489
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,200
This is my classmate Mitsuko.

490
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,240
Thanks.

491
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:44,590
The most ideal brother in the world.

492
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:50,300
Kumiko helped her mom in the kitchen.

493
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:54,800
The perfect mother and daughter.

494
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:59,710
Hey, Shingo! Come on! Dad!

495
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:03,940
Kumiko's dad gave Grandma
a shoulder massage.

496
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,410
Could there be a more family-like family
anywhere in the world?

497
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:13,520
Make yourself at home, Mitsuko.

498
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:18,630
She called me Mitsuko.

499
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:24,160
I, as Mitsuko, became
a member of this family.

500
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:34,980
"The most important thing
You must be connected to yourself, Yuka. "

501
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:40,280
"I'm connected to myself, Yuka"

502
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,720
"You understand, Yuka?"

503
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:52,790
The members of Kumiko's family
were connected to themselves.

504
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:23,920
Wait 5 minutes, then come inside.

505
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:26,460
Okay...

506
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:58,890
Grandpa.

507
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:03,230
You're late, Mitsuko.

508
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,470
Where were you?

509
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,100
Mitsuko.

510
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,640
Come see your grandfather.

511
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,880
Mitsuko is here.

512
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:18,240
Mitsuko...

513
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:23,490
Come closer...

514
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,520
Grandpa!

515
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,490
Grandpa.

516
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:39,830
The new girl is good.

517
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:42,660
He likes you.

518
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:44,330
Good job.

519
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:07,190
You even change your toothbrush
to suit each client.

520
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,590
Pick yours.

521
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:19,270
I'll take this one.

522
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:40,960
A great story opens your eyes.
There's this one story...

523
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:46,720
There was a baby born in a locker.

524
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:50,630
Born in a locker?

525
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:57,870
Years later, the mother found out
the girl's whereabouts and went to...

526
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:00,480
...see her.

527
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:01,810
No way.

528
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,310
They met.

529
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:04,570
Really?

530
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:12,820
Yeah, but the woman was a bad actress.
She sucked at playing a mother.

531
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:33,300
Once upon a time, there was a family.
Parents and two daughters.

532
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:40,180
They were seemingly happy.

533
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:44,990
However...

534
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:01,770
The mother was smart and polite.

535
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:05,980
The father was hard-working.

536
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:15,880
But he didn't try to understand
his daughters. Their individuality.

537
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:21,390
That's why they ran away.

538
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:25,320
The first time in Tokyo's Suginami Ward.

539
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:32,370
Stray cats roamed the back alleys
like blood flows through a vein.

540
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,500
Stray cats form families instantly.

541
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:47,750
No need to feel sorry for them.
They're tough. They own this town.

542
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:58,420
We have to relate to each other
like stray cats do.

543
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,600
We own Tokyo, OK?

544
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,830
We do?

545
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:11,240
Cool.

546
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:20,850
While I was chewing gum,
I thought...

547
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:25,790
"Yes, we own Tokyo. "

548
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:57,120
A middle-aged man came out.
Unkempt hair. Unshaven face.

549
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:01,920
What are you wearing?

550
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:11,240
Get in.

551
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,780
We went inside.

552
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:36,490
At that point, I had no idea
what I was supposed to do.

553
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:41,830
But I knew Kumiko would tell me.

554
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,820
This way.

555
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,640
I walked down the hall.

556
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:57,510
I saw many mortuary tablets
placed on the family altar.

557
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:03,050
Photographs.
His family, probably.

558
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,410
We went into the living room
and followed his orders.

559
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:27,070
Sit!

560
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:55,730
He lit a cigarette.
I sensed that he was my "father. "

561
01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:02,370
I looked at Kumiko.
She looked cute lost in reflection.

562
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:06,740
She closed her eyes.
I saw shiny droplets under her long bangs.

563
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:14,580
Don't cry, stupid.

564
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:16,220
But...

565
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:22,400
I'm not a kid anymore.
Let me do what I want.

566
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,380
Dad.

567
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:46,590
My turn.

568
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:54,260
Dad looked at me with teary eyes.
I loved Dad.

569
01:01:55,230 --> 01:02:01,970
I was his daughter.
He was a lonely, stubborn man.

570
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:07,940
Suddenly, I had a vision
of the Tiny Tokai Times.

571
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,470
Headline "Dad is Lonely"

572
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,410
No, not true.

573
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:24,150
That wasn't my dad.
My real dad was sitting in front of me.

574
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:34,830
He looked depressed.

575
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:46,050
Ever since you girls disappeared,
Daddy's been...

576
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:58,460
...thinking about you nonstop.

577
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:07,540
I didn't forget for a moment.

578
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:12,370
We shouldn't have come back.

579
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:17,670
Wait.

580
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:23,750
We ran down the hall,
opened the door violently.

581
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:29,760
I heard Dad sobbing behind me.
I cried.

582
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:34,260
I couldn't stop.

583
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:35,590
You crying?

584
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:39,270
Let's go back, OK?

585
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:45,340
Slurring my words, I tried to
convince her. She smiled.

586
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:51,140
Let's go back.

587
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,290
Yes, let's go back.

588
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:31,190
Let's do everything over.

589
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:36,160
Can you hear me, Yuka?
Can you hear my voice?

590
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:41,660
I cried with my face buried in his chest, Yuka.

591
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:47,500
I had never done anything like that.

592
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:50,670
I was moved.

593
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:55,240
Kumiko snuggled up to us and sobbed.

594
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,940
We reconciled.

595
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:03,920
Eat all you want.

596
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,730
Sorry it's not much.

597
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:15,960
Next time I'll get more food.
A variety of dishes.

598
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,140
It'll be fun.

599
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:23,800
Your dad just won big on...

600
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:27,640
...bicycle races.

601
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:30,040
Awesome, Dad.

602
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,550
Great.

603
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:38,780
Horse racing, pachinko...
Lately I've been winning them all.

604
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:43,590
It's like a miracle.

605
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:45,420
You're so lucky.

606
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:51,390
So, with that money...

607
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:56,810
I want us to start over.

608
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:06,440
I won't cause you any trouble.

609
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:19,030
Your mother is
watching over us from heaven.

610
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:25,130
Just got kind of emotional, huh?

611
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:29,200
Let's eat.
We have dessert too.

612
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,030
This is a little too sweet.

613
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:49,520
Time's up.

614
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,860
Well...can we finish dinner?

615
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:55,860
Time's up.

616
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,300
You're right.

617
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:05,370
Time just flew by.

618
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:12,240
A little bit longer, Dad.

619
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:17,080
Really?

620
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:24,390
Yeah, you just got back, so...

621
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:30,430
Don't leave again.

622
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:31,930
Dad.

623
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:35,770
Don't go. Please stay.

624
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:39,430
Don't get carried away, asshole.

625
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:45,180
Rules are rules, you fuck.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

626
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,950
Let's get out of here.

627
01:07:56,130 --> 01:07:58,790
Get up.

628
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:01,760
Get the fuck up.

629
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:07,430
Wanna stay here forever?

630
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:28,260
"Yuka? By now, you know what we do?"

631
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:34,420
"It's called 'family rental.' You know it?"

632
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:36,660
That...that was fun. Very fun.

633
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:43,430
"Kumiko, born in a coin locker, has her 25th
birthday is coming up, and we're wondering..."

634
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:47,580
"...which family to celebrate with. "

635
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,180
1 year later

636
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:57,320
In Tokyo, I was waiting for her.

637
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:01,750
Kumiko, a. k. a. Ueno Station 54.
I knew she'd be here.

638
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:11,030
Excuse me.
Kumiko, right?

639
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:16,640
I'd like to talk to you about something.

640
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:18,140
An ordinary girl.

641
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:24,180
If you have any questions about
our services, please call this number.

642
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:25,710
What?

643
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:29,680
I can't explain anything
to you in person.

644
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:40,320
You can't run away from me.

645
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:42,930
"Your support. Personnel placement.
We take all orders"

646
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:44,700
I'll get you.

647
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,440
"...24 Dead..."

648
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:00,810
"...Mass Suicide..."

649
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:14,650
They're late.

650
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,600
Are they here?

651
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:22,760
Who?

652
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,550
That guy?

653
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,280
Him?

654
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:44,420
No.

655
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:56,700
Be cool, be cool, be cool...

656
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:07,280
They're not here yet.

657
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:17,260
Mr. Shimabara?

658
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:18,930
Yes.

659
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:21,290
What do you wanna know?

660
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,000
What?

661
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:25,460
I wanna know the truth.

662
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:38,910
Be cool, be cool...

663
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:49,030
Are you connected to you, Tetsuzo?

664
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:50,490
What?

665
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:54,630
Are you connected to yourself?

666
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:00,670
Yes. That's why I'm here.

667
01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:05,540
I know all about you.

668
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:11,340
Good for you.
I used to be a reporter.

669
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:16,210
Is this Suicide Club's headquarters?

670
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:20,690
Suicide Club? No such thing.

671
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:27,620
There are theories of cults and mass hysteria,
of cult groups embracing messiahs...

672
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:31,390
...and the apocalypse,
all linked to a Suicide Club.

673
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:35,290
Suicide Club this, Suicide Club that.

674
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:38,460
It's even in the media.

675
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:43,000
Don't pretend like you don't know.

676
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:50,410
But it seems like they've forgotten
about that incident at Shinjuku.

677
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:59,260
54 people died there.
But humans are forgetful creatures.

678
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,760
People forget everything.

679
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,540
There is no Suicide Club.
It's all a product of your apathetic curiosity.

680
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:12,210
There is no Suicide Club.
It's all a product of your apathetic curiosity.
Be cool, be cool...

681
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:12,570
Be cool, be cool...

682
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,310
Even strongly put, it's more of
a suicide social group. It's a circle.

683
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:17,750
Even strongly put, it's more of
a suicide social group. It's a circle.
Be strong.

684
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:23,850
Even strongly put, it's more of
a suicide social group. It's a circle.

685
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:25,180
A circle?

686
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:32,790
Anyway, imagine that the Sun Goddess
was born in a locker.

687
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:44,340
The collapse of civilization began
at the #54 locker at Ueno Station.

688
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:12,500
Ueno Station, locker #54.

689
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:16,170
She runs a family-rental business
called I.C. Corp.

690
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:19,580
"Three-Day-Old Coin Locker Baby Found"
She runs a family-rental business
called I.C. Corp.

691
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:20,340
"Three-Day-Old Coin Locker Baby Found"

692
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:26,180
When requested, they go spend time
with their clients...

693
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:32,310
...and pretend
to be their family members.

694
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:37,760
Sometimes for 10 years or 2O years.

695
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:43,260
What is he saying?
What is he talking about?

696
01:14:43,370 --> 01:14:48,630
She has many companies, including
several masquerading as car rentals.

697
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:50,600
Do you understand?

698
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,800
What about the Suicide Club?

699
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:56,170
What about it?

700
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:02,190
It's the result of
Kumiko's grudge, right?

701
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,820
What Kumiko wanted was...

702
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:15,020
...to live a normal life
and be a normal girl, right?

703
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:21,900
So she acted like a normal girl
in family-rental situations.

704
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:28,810
But that wasn't enough.
She wanted revenge.

705
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:33,140
She wanted to turn
every kid into Kumiko.

706
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:38,920
There's nothing more to tell you.

707
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,080
What?

708
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:43,060
I told you everything.

709
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:50,530
Now, everyone else is starting to realize
what they have to do.

710
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:55,500
Don't you know?

711
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:59,770
Be cool, be cool...

712
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:11,850
You tried so hard to figure us out.

713
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:19,720
I know all about you.
But what do you know?

714
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:26,130
You used to be a reporter.
But it's over and you can relax now.

715
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:29,940
I want my daughters back.

716
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:31,110
"Missing"
I want my daughters back.

717
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:32,300
I want my daughters back.

718
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,310
"Searching for Lost Puppies"

719
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:43,750
It's time for you to wake up to your role.

720
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:45,820
Who are you?

721
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:51,430
You said you were connected
to yourself, but are you really?

722
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:57,820
You're not believable
as a reporter or a father.

723
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:03,730
The world is full of lies that people
can't play their roles convincingly.

724
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:09,610
They fail as husbands, wives,
fathers, mothers, children, etc.

725
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:14,240
So, the only way to figure out
what we can be...

726
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:20,420
...is to lie openly
and pursue emptiness.

727
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:25,750
Feel the desert.
Experience loneliness. Feel it.

728
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:32,100
Survive the desert.
That is your role.

729
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:48,750
That night, I had a strange dream.

730
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:55,780
The desert.
Was this what he meant?

731
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:59,690
I was in their hideout.

732
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:03,720
Was this really their hideout?

733
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:07,900
I sensed Noriko and Yuka were here.

734
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:14,370
I knew they were alive.
They were here.

735
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:18,510
I felt their presence profoundly.

736
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,180
Noriko...her voice...

737
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:30,820
Yuka...5 years old...running into
the kitchen...holding the newspaper...

738
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,560
They were alive.

739
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:39,170
Why did Noriko run away from home
during a blackout in late 2001?

740
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:47,340
Tetsuzo, what's your connection
to Toyokawa? To your family?

741
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:52,210
To yourself?
State it in 50 words or less.

742
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:55,540
Yuka.

743
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:09,030
Noriko.

744
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:27,550
I heard that guy's voice.
Suddenly I was back in the desert.

745
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:37,650
I had to go on and find them.

746
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:40,990
I woke up.

747
01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:45,320
TETSUZO

748
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:34,720
Hello?

749
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:37,890
Tetsu? It's me.

750
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:41,890
I'm almost there.

751
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:46,190
What story are you working on?

752
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:49,690
I'll tell you later.

753
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:54,240
OK. I'll see you shortly.

754
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:05,370
What would I say to Yuka?
I wondered.

755
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:11,250
What was she thinking when she wrote this story?
Even if I was there, I couldn't be there for her.

756
01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:20,620
She disappeared the next day...

757
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:24,770
It wasn't just some kind of
hypothetical situation.

758
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:28,400
She was clearly expressing anger at me.

759
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:33,600
Immediately quitting my job as editor-in-chief
the day after Yuka ran away...

760
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,970
I didn't do that.

761
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:44,780
I went to work like nothing happened,
same as when Noriko disappeared

762
01:21:47,390 --> 01:21:51,620
Is it OK like this?

763
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:53,460
That's fine.

764
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:58,000
Now, about the new Toyokawa history corner...

765
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:05,530
The following day, our top story was
about Toyokawa's public library.

766
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:09,800
It was 2 months later
that I finally quit my job.

767
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,910
Because my wife killed herself.

768
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:21,750
Can I take a picture?

769
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:26,660
I thought Yuka would be shocked.

770
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:30,660
I was an even worse father
than she had imagined.

771
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:34,770
I chose my career over my family.

772
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:34,970
Would you like to take a look?...
I chose my career over my family.

773
01:22:34,970 --> 01:22:35,570
Would you like to take a look?...

774
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:37,140
Would you like to take a look?...
I took pride in my work because this
newspaper was a symbol of peace.

775
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:42,670
I took pride in my work because this
newspaper was a symbol of peace.

776
01:22:56,260 --> 01:23:04,690
In Toyokawa, The blue sky, the ocean,
the harbor, farms and mountains...

777
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,870
It was the perfect town.

778
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:15,440
I wrote pastoral fluff pieces for the paper,
like an artist sketching the blue sky.

779
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:26,550
We all lived in this perfect town.

780
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:32,390
My daughters were residents of Toyokawa.

781
01:23:36,330 --> 01:23:38,890
Point at that thing.

782
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,730
Look at Daddy.

783
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:43,570
Let's take a picture.

784
01:23:43,710 --> 01:23:45,200
Picture time.

785
01:23:45,710 --> 01:23:48,370
Come on, Noriko.

786
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,700
Right there.

787
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,680
Point at that thing.

788
01:23:54,650 --> 01:23:56,590
Ready?

789
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:03,520
Impressive.

790
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,770
Come take a look at this.

791
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:14,330
Noriko, Yuka, come on.

792
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:18,110
Look.

793
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,410
A happy family.

794
01:24:24,650 --> 01:24:29,520
When my wife did a painting
based on that photograph...

795
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:33,790
I failed to notice
my daughters' expressions.

796
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:42,860
Yuka wrote "All he understood was that
he didn't understand them at all. "

797
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:49,960
When I read that, I cried.

798
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,260
Fuck this.

799
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:24,270
A bunch of crap.

800
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:37,020
I had all these notes
on the walls of my room.

801
01:25:48,570 --> 01:25:52,430
Fuck all this.

802
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,200
A month later...

803
01:25:58,910 --> 01:26:00,340
My wife died.

804
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:03,600
She was tired.

805
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:05,310
Taeko.

806
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:16,890
I read the notes repeatedly.

807
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:21,020
Even though Yuka saw right through me...

808
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:28,400
Yuka could simulate me, but I couldn't simulate
my daughter's actions in my mind...

809
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:33,740
...or my wife's.

810
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:43,080
Right here.

811
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:50,920
Here.

812
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:03,400
I'm so sorry.

813
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:08,110
It's all my fault.

814
01:27:08,810 --> 01:27:11,800
Had I been a good mother,
they wouldn't have...

815
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,040
What?
Don't say that.

816
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:20,620
It's not your fault.
It's all right.

817
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:41,740
Taeko.

818
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:52,620
What are you still doing up?

819
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:02,460
Taeko?

820
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:06,600
Hey, Taeko?

821
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:16,410
Hey...

822
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:43,600
While I had my eyes averted from
the bloody stench of reality, ...

823
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:47,840
...my two daughters disappeared
from this forced peaceful painting.

824
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:54,720
Taeko!

825
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:11,060
Calm down.

826
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:30,810
It's all right.

827
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,070
No red balloons.

828
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:44,280
I would've done anything to catch them if they'd
promised to take me to my girls.

829
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:50,790
Tetsu.

830
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:58,420
How you been?

831
01:29:58,530 --> 01:30:00,470
Hey. This way.

832
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,970
What's the hurry?

833
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:04,130
Sit.

834
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:11,140
You know the Suicide Club?

835
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:15,650
I started talking right away.

836
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:20,080
A summary of my life in 30 sec.

837
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:20,560
This is my daughter. She ran away...

838
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:24,860
This is my daughter. She ran away...
I then explained why I was in Tokyo.

839
01:30:25,930 --> 01:30:31,330
I then handed him my notes,
and told him...

840
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:36,300
...to finish what I had started,
if something happened to me.

841
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:42,070
I don't understand.

842
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:48,520
Things have changed.

843
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:54,280
After today,
I don't know if I'll be safe.

844
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:58,990
You're the only one I can trust
with this information.

845
01:31:00,130 --> 01:31:04,460
What exactly do you want me to do?

846
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:07,470
If you disappear, then what?

847
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:14,270
Suppose this Suicide Club exists.
What am I supposed to do with it?

848
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:20,040
You'll know what to do.
It's right up your alley.

849
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:24,340
I'm gonna go now.
Wait here for a woman, Kumiko.

850
01:31:24,490 --> 01:31:30,980
She'll be here in a minute.
Tell her you want a family.

851
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:37,630
This is the scenario
My daughters, Noriko and Yuka.

852
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:43,130
They'll play your daughters.

853
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:48,870
Kumiko will play your wife, Taeko.

854
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:52,210
Noriko and Yuka will be called...

855
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:57,910
...Mitsuko and Yoko, respectively.
Their favorite aliases.

856
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:05,020
Anyway, I have to go.
I'll tell you more later.

857
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:47,970
Yeah?

858
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:02,240
You called us?

859
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:03,940
Yes.

860
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:06,780
We appreciate your business.

861
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:09,590
Come on in.

862
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:11,750
Thanks.

863
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:16,590
Please sit.

864
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:20,330
So, let's talk.

865
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:23,800
You want to be the father, correct?

866
01:33:24,410 --> 01:33:25,300
Yes.

867
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:29,740
You want a wife and two daughters?

868
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:31,740
Yes.

869
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:39,180
Look through this photo album
and pick who you want.

870
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:51,460
I like this girl.

871
01:33:56,140 --> 01:34:04,640
The older sister will be Mitsuko.
The younger sister will be Yoko.

872
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:09,840
And my wife...

873
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:28,060
Hey, Sis.

874
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:31,500
Sis?

875
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:39,850
Mitsuko doesn't need to act right now.

876
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,920
No acting when you have no role.

877
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:51,320
I was embarrassed. I knew she
wasn't my real sister anymore.

878
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:55,260
I needed more practice.

879
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:59,060
You need more practice.

880
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:04,860
You're Yoko.
She's Mitsuko.

881
01:35:05,710 --> 01:35:08,610
Not Yuka, not Noriko.
Not sisters.

882
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,370
Forget that.

883
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:33,630
Memorize this address.
Study the area.

884
01:35:34,740 --> 01:35:42,270
Stores, banks, cigarette machines...
Know where everything is.

885
01:35:43,510 --> 01:35:47,540
He wants to act like he's been
in this town for 20 years.

886
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:51,950
So we have to act like
we've been here for 20 years.

887
01:35:56,690 --> 01:36:01,790
He wants us to be
his family members.

888
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:06,660
I'm his wife.
You're his daughters.

889
01:36:07,870 --> 01:36:14,100
This time you're sisters.

890
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:25,650
This guy is your father.

891
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:30,590
They stared at the photograph,
and then closed their eyes.

892
01:36:30,690 --> 01:36:34,250
They imagined being his daughters.
I looked at the photo...

893
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:38,030
...doing that made the father's face
become flesh and blood.

894
01:36:38,130 --> 01:36:42,970
I look at the customer's face.
Not to become his wife.

895
01:36:43,770 --> 01:36:50,340
But to make sure it wasn't
the same guy from before.

896
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:56,180
That guy I met - Tetsuzo.

897
01:36:58,490 --> 01:37:03,550
I knew for sure he was behind this.

898
01:37:04,090 --> 01:37:06,180
Tetsuzo Shimabara.

899
01:37:14,570 --> 01:37:15,870
Mitsuko.

900
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:18,030
Yes?

901
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:26,440
Do you still have the coat you were
wearing when you ran away?

902
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:28,780
Yeah.

903
01:37:31,150 --> 01:37:34,780
You have it now?

904
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:38,290
Yeah.

905
01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:43,830
Can I see it?

906
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:49,670
Sure.

907
01:37:56,940 --> 01:38:00,710
I remember this.

908
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:03,420
Can you put it on?

909
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:05,650
Okay.

910
01:38:16,630 --> 01:38:19,600
Can you imitate Noriko with this?

911
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:38,890
I want you to wear it today, Mitsuko.

912
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:42,850
Former sisters...

913
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:46,260
He's not a regular client.

914
01:38:48,830 --> 01:38:50,690
Be careful.

915
01:38:51,230 --> 01:38:55,100
They weren't ready for this.

916
01:38:56,900 --> 01:39:05,310
Often times, people came to us
to relive their past.

917
01:39:05,910 --> 01:39:06,740
Business card.

918
01:39:06,850 --> 01:39:10,610
5 years ago, I met someone who
claimed to be my real mother.

919
01:39:11,950 --> 01:39:16,410
She begged for a chance to fix
our relationship.

920
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:23,760
Sayuri Yoshida?
You're a "flower coordinator"?

921
01:39:24,870 --> 01:39:26,990
What's that?

922
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:31,470
You read my letter?

923
01:39:32,570 --> 01:39:33,670
Yeah.

924
01:39:37,310 --> 01:39:40,410
I read it, Mom.

925
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:42,140
I called her Mom.

926
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:43,410
Thank you.

927
01:39:45,820 --> 01:39:46,880
Mom.

928
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,690
Once again.

929
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:52,790
Slowly.

930
01:39:53,690 --> 01:39:55,250
Mom.

931
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:56,760
Mitsuko.

932
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,190
I don't know that name.

933
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:04,130
You know how much I missed you?

934
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:06,130
I'm sorry, Mitsuko.

935
01:40:06,570 --> 01:40:08,870
Who's Mitsuko?

936
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:13,700
I always think about you.

937
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:15,880
Thank you, Mitsuko.

938
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:24,050
Where's Dad?

939
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:29,990
We're back together now.

940
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:39,830
And? You suck at acting.
You wanna switch?

941
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:41,740
What do you mean?

942
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:45,640
You want me to play the mother's role?

943
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:52,020
Now you listen to me.

944
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:59,150
If you want, I can play your mother,
you bitch.

945
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:07,730
A locker is my mother.

946
01:41:08,870 --> 01:41:12,100
I told her a locker was my mother.

947
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:21,540
The woman cried and screamed,
but I didn't give a shit.

948
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:23,170
You' re so cruel !

949
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:23,320
Even if she was my real mother,
she didn't convince me at all.

950
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:26,350
I' m cruel?
Yes, let' s do a cruel role play!
Even if she was my real mother,
she didn't convince me at all.

951
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:31,290
Even if she was my real mother,
she didn't convince me at all.

952
01:41:31,290 --> 01:41:32,260
Express more suffering.
Even if she was my real mother,
she didn't convince me at all.

953
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:33,520
Express more suffering.

954
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:37,460
Just an amateur actress.

955
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,600
She couldn't play it well.

956
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:40,900
So easy. Crying is the easiest form of acting.
She couldn't play it well.

957
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:42,340
So easy. Crying is the easiest form of acting.

958
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:44,570
So easy. Crying is the easiest form of acting.
I thought about showing her
how to play the role properly.

959
01:41:44,570 --> 01:41:50,530
I thought about showing her
how to play the role properly.

960
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:57,040
I want to start over.

961
01:41:57,180 --> 01:41:59,410
Would Tetsuzo say that too?

962
01:41:59,550 --> 01:42:01,150
Practice with us.

963
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,990
I'll do anything.

964
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:16,300
She says she'll practice playing mother with us.

965
01:42:18,370 --> 01:42:19,500
Sayuri.

966
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:24,670
I'll do anything.

967
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:31,680
Take her.

968
01:42:42,230 --> 01:42:43,530
Wait.

969
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:48,760
Bring along your man.
We'll make him a "father. "

970
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:52,370
He's here now.

971
01:42:55,410 --> 01:42:56,380
Where?

972
01:43:03,450 --> 01:43:04,470
Mitsuko.

973
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:08,320
Take him too.

974
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:14,520
Their daughter was
probably named Mitsuko.

975
01:43:25,010 --> 01:43:26,340
Mitsuko...

976
01:43:34,110 --> 01:43:40,140
A few years later,
a girl named Mitsuko showed up.

977
01:43:49,630 --> 01:43:57,040
If you do a good job tonight,
you'll finally become the real you.

978
01:43:58,840 --> 01:43:59,700
OK.

979
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:02,030
Mitsuko?

980
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:04,240
OK.

981
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:12,940
But remember, you're not real sisters.
It's all acting.

982
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:16,790
The guy will play your father.

983
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:20,960
Don't let him confuse you.

984
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,360
OK?

985
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:35,080
"8:.29 PM"

986
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:36,410
"8:.29 PM"
I had all the lights on.

987
01:44:36,410 --> 01:44:38,640
I had all the lights on.

988
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:43,750
I heard a car stop outside.

989
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:46,810
It was a gamble.

990
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:50,780
They're here.

991
01:44:54,430 --> 01:44:56,260
What did I want?

992
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,970
To regain my pride and dignity?

993
01:45:01,870 --> 01:45:08,800
No, I just wanted to show them
what I was capable of.

994
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:11,440
This was a party.

995
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:13,840
A surprise party.

996
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:20,180
I grasped my wife's knife
that I had in my pocket.

997
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:23,550
I suddenly regretted my whole life.

998
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:29,190
For some reason as I felt that regret,
I also loved it.

999
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:34,230
How was Hokkaido?

1000
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:46,670
We're home.

1001
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:52,680
I had looked for a house
that resembled my own.

1002
01:45:57,120 --> 01:46:00,180
This one's very similar.

1003
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:04,390
You're right.

1004
01:46:04,970 --> 01:46:08,060
- Can we go look at it now?
- Sure.

1005
01:46:08,170 --> 01:46:09,360
Thanks.

1006
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:10,500
Here.

1007
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:12,000
Great.

1008
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:16,240
I think it meets your criteria.

1009
01:46:17,010 --> 01:46:18,810
Can we go inside?

1010
01:46:19,150 --> 01:46:20,140
Sure.

1011
01:46:21,850 --> 01:46:25,010
Be careful.
Put the cabinet in this room.

1012
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:29,350
I transported everything.

1013
01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:37,090
Furniture, Noriko's stuff, Yuka's stuff...

1014
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:41,530
Everything.

1015
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:03,520
We're home.

1016
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:07,590
I'm exhausted.

1017
01:47:07,730 --> 01:47:08,790
Welcome home.

1018
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:10,290
Hi, Dad.

1019
01:47:11,770 --> 01:47:15,200
I'm so tired.

1020
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,030
I missed you.

1021
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:29,650
Noriko and Yuka carried
their big travel bags.

1022
01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:43,420
It was the first time in 2 years
that I saw my daughters.

1023
01:47:44,570 --> 01:47:47,500
My heart was beating.
All those repressed emotions welled up.

1024
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:31,170
Mitsuko, Yoko...

1025
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:33,810
Something wrong?

1026
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:51,030
"How was Hokkaido?"
Ikeda started a conversation.

1027
01:48:51,170 --> 01:48:53,070
I humored him.

1028
01:48:53,330 --> 01:49:00,070
Mitsuko, smiling,
got up and went to hug him.

1029
01:49:00,810 --> 01:49:02,740
I missed you.

1030
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:06,740
I missed you too.

1031
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:10,070
It wasn't the same without you.

1032
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:17,590
Corny acting. Was this what their
lonely, desperate clients wanted?

1033
01:49:18,630 --> 01:49:24,150
But I was lonely and desperate too.

1034
01:49:25,170 --> 01:49:28,030
I've prepared sukiyaki for you.

1035
01:49:29,970 --> 01:49:31,560
Wonderful.

1036
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:33,540
Oh, no.

1037
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,000
What?

1038
01:49:35,110 --> 01:49:38,540
Taeko, come here.

1039
01:49:38,650 --> 01:49:39,940
What?

1040
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:41,200
Problem?

1041
01:49:47,990 --> 01:49:49,510
What's the matter?

1042
01:49:50,290 --> 01:49:54,590
I forgot to buy meat.

1043
01:49:57,430 --> 01:49:59,020
What was I thinking?

1044
01:49:59,670 --> 01:50:03,100
You're just tired.
It's all right.

1045
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:05,470
I'll go buy it.

1046
01:50:06,170 --> 01:50:08,230
But you just got back.

1047
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:11,400
It's OK. I'll be right back.

1048
01:50:11,650 --> 01:50:15,270
Get me 3 packs of Cherry Cigarettes, too.

1049
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:16,810
OK.

1050
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:20,050
I needed to buy time.

1051
01:50:20,790 --> 01:50:24,420
Cherry Cigarettes were hard to find.

1052
01:50:26,930 --> 01:50:28,590
Kumiko was gone.

1053
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:31,230
I heard the door shut.

1054
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:38,270
Vegetables, shirataki noodles...

1055
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:44,100
Ikeda went back to the room.

1056
01:50:51,890 --> 01:50:53,580
Put your bags in your room.

1057
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:34,330
Sis?

1058
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:36,660
Yeah?

1059
01:51:40,470 --> 01:51:43,160
Been a long day, huh?

1060
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:46,840
Yeah.

1061
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:53,800
Just like old times, isn't it?

1062
01:51:55,050 --> 01:51:56,880
Come downstairs.

1063
01:51:57,780 --> 01:51:59,550
Hurry.

1064
01:51:59,690 --> 01:52:00,550
OK.

1065
01:52:19,510 --> 01:52:23,170
I didn't have much time.

1066
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:26,380
I had to act efficiently.

1067
01:52:27,610 --> 01:52:29,580
My daughters were smiling.

1068
01:52:30,980 --> 01:52:35,050
They looked so lovely.

1069
01:52:38,090 --> 01:52:44,090
I had made up my past and stuffed it all
in the back of a cold locker, in that metal box.

1070
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:55,040
But in reality it was a cardboard box.
Soft and fragile, it would dissolve in the rain.

1071
01:52:55,210 --> 01:52:59,650
An outline...
Humans have an outline.

1072
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:06,350
I wanted to make him a solid father.

1073
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:12,680
It wasn't long ago that
Broken Dam was stabbed to death.

1074
01:53:12,830 --> 01:53:14,320
Phone for you.

1075
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:17,860
How may I help you?

1076
01:53:19,370 --> 01:53:20,060
What?

1077
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:21,530
He wants to kill me.

1078
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:22,900
You're gonna die?

1079
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,870
Maybe. Could you leave?

1080
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:30,580
Cheerfully, Broken Dam delivered
her final lecture.

1081
01:53:30,580 --> 01:53:32,880
Cheerfully, Broken Dam delivered
her final lecture.

1082
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:34,810
I took psychology.

1083
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:39,850
In class, a bully and
his victim reversed roles...

1084
01:53:40,420 --> 01:53:45,550
...and the bully felt the victim's
pain for the first time and wailed.

1085
01:53:45,790 --> 01:53:47,050
He what?

1086
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:48,520
He wept.

1087
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:50,650
- Sorry I'm late.
- Have a seat.

1088
01:53:52,830 --> 01:53:59,240
The bully learned his lesson
and never bullied again.

1089
01:54:01,270 --> 01:54:08,010
So, someone has to play
the role of a victim.

1090
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:19,650
Everyone wants to be champagne,
not the glass. A flower, not the vase.

1091
01:54:20,230 --> 01:54:25,890
But the world needs glasses and vases.
These roles need to be filled.

1092
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:32,360
Like a master/servant relationship.
Maybe that's how capitalism is?

1093
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:35,170
- What's capitalism?
- I'll tell you later.

1094
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:39,410
Lovers, spouses, family members...

1095
01:54:40,250 --> 01:54:44,270
We all need to reverse roles and...

1096
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:50,380
...figure out what each of us
is meant to be.

1097
01:54:52,660 --> 01:54:55,220
Survival of the fittest?

1098
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,020
So cute.

1099
01:54:59,370 --> 01:55:02,820
We need rabbits.
Not just lions.

1100
01:55:03,540 --> 01:55:09,440
Rabbits and lions can't switch places,
but we human beings can.

1101
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:15,650
Some will kill.
Some will be killed.

1102
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:20,880
That's the circle of life,
though there are contradictions.

1103
01:55:21,860 --> 01:55:29,280
Just like the numbers after 3.14 in pi continue
without end, real circles can never be perfect.

1104
01:55:30,030 --> 01:55:36,960
But if you draw a circle with
a compass and a big fat marker...

1105
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:43,140
...a thick outline will
make it seem perfect.

1106
01:55:44,380 --> 01:55:48,250
I'll give you a sense
of perfection, Tetsuzo.

1107
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:53,940
You can be a lion.
I'll be a rabbit.

1108
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:57,790
I don't need thick outlines.

1109
01:55:58,120 --> 01:56:00,750
My metal box is starting to rot.

1110
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:05,660
I'm gonna go to a higher level.

1111
01:56:06,630 --> 01:56:12,590
A rabbit, a suicide, a killer, evil,
water overflowing from a glass. .

1112
01:56:13,070 --> 01:56:16,470
I'll be whatever no one else wants to be.

1113
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:21,810
I'm sick of shameless outlines of
people seeking happiness.

1114
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:25,980
They don't wanna be rabbits.
They just wanna eat rabbits.

1115
01:56:26,090 --> 01:56:28,280
There's no such jungle.

1116
01:56:29,260 --> 01:56:32,710
While our club expanded...

1117
01:56:33,930 --> 01:56:39,830
Broken Dam, Cripple #5,
Long Neck, Midnight...they all died.

1118
01:56:40,930 --> 01:56:45,030
Some killed themselves.
Some were killed.

1119
01:56:45,770 --> 01:56:51,400
Broken Dam went to see a client who hated his
Wife in a hotel room. I went along.

1120
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:54,540
Red carpet in the hall.

1121
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:56,180
I'll turn it on.

1122
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:59,180
You know what song he requested?

1123
01:57:01,790 --> 01:57:03,090
- Some SMAP song?
- Wrong.

1124
01:57:03,690 --> 01:57:04,820
What?

1125
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:08,090
Hint? Think, a geyser of blood.

1126
01:57:08,530 --> 01:57:09,430
What?

1127
01:57:10,900 --> 01:57:13,260
Blood won't be noticeable here.

1128
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,700
- I got it. "Wine-Red Heart" ?
- Wrong.

1129
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:21,600
Just turn on the radio in 3O sec.

1130
01:57:21,810 --> 01:57:22,870
OK.

1131
01:57:26,650 --> 01:57:28,880
Why weren't you with me that day?

1132
01:57:29,020 --> 01:57:30,740
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

1133
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:32,410
- "Bright Red Sun" ?
- Wrong.

1134
01:57:37,490 --> 01:57:39,250
Forgive me.

1135
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:44,790
Why did you go see him?
You fuckin' love him?

1136
01:57:44,860 --> 01:57:46,000
I'm sorry I betrayed your trust.

1137
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,470
I'm sorry I betrayed your trust.
...beautiful song, isn't it?

1138
01:57:47,470 --> 01:57:48,700
...beautiful song, isn't it?

1139
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:55,170
This next song is a request from
someone named...Broken Dam?

1140
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:59,040
It's called "Blossom of a Red Rose. "

1141
01:57:59,180 --> 01:58:01,080
"Blossom of a Red Rose. "

1142
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:04,080
It's your favorite.
Let's sing.

1143
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:05,320
"A rose has bloomed, a rose has bloomed,
a pure red rose"
It's your favorite.
Let's sing.

1144
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:05,520
"A rose has bloomed, a rose has bloomed,
a pure red rose"

1145
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:06,420
"A rose has bloomed, a rose has bloomed,
a pure red rose"
Shut up.

1146
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:07,020
"A rose has bloomed, a rose has bloomed,
a pure red rose"

1147
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:11,660
"A rose has bloomed, a rose has bloomed,
a pure red rose"
...a rose has bloomed...
...a pure red rose...

1148
01:58:11,660 --> 01:58:12,630
...a rose has bloomed...
...a pure red rose...

1149
01:58:12,630 --> 01:58:13,730
"In my lonely garden a rose has bloomed"
...a rose has bloomed...
...a pure red rose...

1150
01:58:13,730 --> 01:58:19,200
"In my lonely garden a rose has bloomed"

1151
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:19,970
"In my lonely garden a rose has bloomed"
...in my lonely garden...

1152
01:58:19,970 --> 01:58:21,230
...in my lonely garden...

1153
01:58:21,230 --> 01:58:22,500
"One tiny rose"
...in my lonely garden...

1154
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:26,740
"One tiny rose"

1155
01:58:26,740 --> 01:58:28,940
"One tiny rose"
...one tiny rose...

1156
01:58:28,940 --> 01:58:29,610
...one tiny rose...

1157
01:58:29,610 --> 01:58:33,480
"My lonely garden is more cheerful"
...one tiny rose...

1158
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:35,720
"My lonely garden is more cheerful"

1159
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:37,220

...in my lonely garden...

1160
01:58:37,220 --> 01:58:38,020
...in my lonely garden...

1161
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:38,920
"Rose, rose, little rose"
...in my lonely garden...

1162
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:45,390
"Rose, rose, little rose"

1163
01:58:45,390 --> 01:58:46,190
"Rose, rose, little rose"
...rose...little rose...

1164
01:58:46,190 --> 01:58:46,960
...rose...little rose...

1165
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:53,330
"Bloom just like you are right there"
...rose...little rose...

1166
01:58:53,330 --> 01:58:54,570
"Bloom just like you are right there"

1167
01:58:54,570 --> 01:58:55,600
"Bloom just like you are right there"

"A rose has bloomed, a rose has bloomed,
a pure red rose"
...bloom just...

1170
01:58:57,870 --> 01:59:04,210
"A rose has bloomed, a rose has bloomed,
a pure red rose"

1171
01:59:04,710 --> 01:59:12,310
"My lonely garden is more cheerful"

1172
01:59:17,690 --> 01:59:19,890
Here. Thank you.

1173
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:24,790
Thanks.

1174
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:31,370
A look of satisfaction on his big fat
stupid face. A happy murderer.

1175
01:59:31,370 --> 01:59:36,340
"The rose lost its petals so suddenly"
A look of satisfaction on his big fat
stupid face. A happy murderer.

1176
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:37,340
"The rose lost its petals so suddenly"

1177
01:59:37,340 --> 01:59:39,380
"The rose lost its petals so suddenly"
"Forgive me, sweetheart, "
Broken Dam said over and over.

"Forgive me, sweetheart, "
Broken Dam said over and over.

"My garden is lonely as it was before"
"Forgive me, sweetheart, "
Broken Dam said over and over.

1180

"My garden is lonely as it was before"

1181
01:59:43,380 --> 01:59:47,450
"My garden is lonely as it was before"
"You deserve this, you fuckin' whore. "

1182
01:59:47,450 --> 01:59:48,420
"You deserve this, you fuckin' whore. "

1183
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:49,060
"My garden's rose has lost its petal but"
"You deserve this, you fuckin' whore. "

1184
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:49,790
"My garden's rose has lost its petal but"

1185
01:59:49,790 --> 01:59:52,230
"My garden's rose has lost its petal but"
The man stabbed her repeatedly.

1186
01:59:52,230 --> 01:59:53,290
"My garden's rose has lost its petal but"

1187
01:59:53,290 --> 01:59:56,530
"My garden's rose has lost its petal but"
Broken Dam played her role
and died happily.

1188
01:59:56,530 --> 01:59:56,930
Broken Dam played her role
and died happily.

1189
01:59:56,930 --> 01:59:58,260
"A rose has bloomed in my lonely heart"
Broken Dam played her role
and died happily.

1190
01:59:58,260 --> 02:00:03,470
"A rose has bloomed in my lonely heart"

1191
02:00:03,470 --> 02:00:04,540
"A rose has bloomed in my lonely heart"
Did she really die?

1192
02:00:04,540 --> 02:00:05,370
Did she really die?

1193
02:00:05,370 --> 02:00:06,010
"Oh rose, rose, rose of my heart"
Did she really die?

1194
02:00:06,010 --> 02:00:06,140
"Oh rose, rose, rose of my heart"

1195
02:00:06,140 --> 02:00:06,940
"Oh rose, rose, rose of my heart"
Yeah.

1196
02:00:06,940 --> 02:00:07,140
"Oh rose, rose, rose of my heart"

1197
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:08,940
"Oh rose, rose, rose of my heart"
Alright!

1198
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:09,040
"Oh rose, rose, rose of my heart"

1199
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:10,510
"Oh rose, rose, rose of my heart"
You're next.

1200
02:00:10,510 --> 02:00:12,310
"Oh rose, rose, rose of my heart"

1201
02:00:12,310 --> 02:00:13,380
"Oh rose, rose, rose of my heart"
I'll do my best.

1202
02:00:14,110 --> 02:00:22,210
"Forever blooming there"

1203
02:01:05,430 --> 02:01:06,430
Cripple #5, Long Neck, and Midnight...

1204
02:01:06,430 --> 02:01:10,940
"Forever blooming there"
Cripple #5, Long Neck, and Midnight...

1205
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:11,200
"Forever blooming there"

1206
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:13,340
"Forever blooming there"
...jumped off the platform.

1207
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:14,070
"Forever blooming there"

1208
02:01:14,070 --> 02:01:14,610
"Forever blooming there"
I made Mitsuko witness it.

1209
02:01:14,610 --> 02:01:15,780
I made Mitsuko witness it.

1210
02:01:15,780 --> 02:01:18,440
"A rose has bloomed, a rose has bloomed,
a pure red rose"
I made Mitsuko witness it.

1211
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:19,210
"A rose has bloomed, a rose has bloomed,
a pure red rose"

1212
02:01:19,210 --> 02:01:23,220
"A rose has bloomed, a rose has bloomed,
a pure red rose"
I wanted her to undertake a task
of such magnitude someday.

1213
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:24,380
I wanted her to undertake a task
of such magnitude someday.

1214
02:01:24,380 --> 02:01:25,080
"My lonely garden is more cheerful"
I wanted her to undertake a task
of such magnitude someday.

1215
02:01:25,080 --> 02:01:25,620
"My lonely garden is more cheerful"

1216
02:01:25,620 --> 02:01:31,260
"My lonely garden is more cheerful"
She was still seeking happiness.
She had come to Tokyo to be happy.

1217
02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:31,850
"My lonely garden is more cheerful"

1218
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:38,660
But I knew she'd transcend it.

1219
02:02:09,260 --> 02:02:14,560
After I finished shopping,
I headed back home, a happy wife.

1220
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:24,970
THE KNIFE IN MY P0CKET

1221
02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:36,750
What?

1222
02:02:39,790 --> 02:02:42,060
Are you 0K, Dad?

1223
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:52,200
Something wrong, Dad?

1224
02:02:52,340 --> 02:02:59,210
They kept saying "Dad. " Was that
how they pleased all their "fathers" ?

1225
02:02:59,450 --> 02:03:06,210
There's someone I want you to meet.

1226
02:03:07,750 --> 02:03:08,580
Who?

1227
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:11,050
This is fun.

1228
02:03:15,330 --> 02:03:17,190
Come on out, Tetsu.

1229
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:24,600
Tetsu.

1230
02:03:26,340 --> 02:03:27,860
Now.

1231
02:03:59,140 --> 02:04:00,400
Hello.

1232
02:04:07,610 --> 02:04:11,010
He has wanted to see you.

1233
02:04:14,890 --> 02:04:16,620
Sit down.

1234
02:04:20,060 --> 02:04:24,120
We're not gonna wait for the meat.
Right, Tetsuzo?

1235
02:04:25,430 --> 02:04:26,860
Come on.

1236
02:04:27,730 --> 02:04:29,290
Introduce yourself.

1237
02:04:30,070 --> 02:04:34,370
You want me to introduce you?

1238
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:40,110
Do something.

1239
02:04:40,650 --> 02:04:42,310
You're their father.

1240
02:04:54,760 --> 02:04:56,350
What are you doing?

1241
02:04:59,630 --> 02:05:01,960
What's this guy's problem?

1242
02:05:04,670 --> 02:05:09,400
Hey, stranger.
You're scaring Yoko.

1243
02:05:10,210 --> 02:05:11,470
Stranger?

1244
02:05:12,550 --> 02:05:15,910
This is Yoko. You don't know?

1245
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:21,250
By the way, stranger...

1246
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:29,830
I'll tell you my name.
My name is Mitsuko.

1247
02:05:30,460 --> 02:05:34,230
Can you remember that?

1248
02:05:34,630 --> 02:05:36,900
I'm Mitsuko.

1249
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:49,540
I want to start over.

1250
02:05:50,850 --> 02:05:51,780
Noriko.

1251
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:53,410
Yuka.

1252
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:58,390
I'm your dad. Your father.

1253
02:06:01,830 --> 02:06:04,560
I'm out of here.

1254
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:08,600
Noriko, Yuka.
Talk to your father.

1255
02:06:20,250 --> 02:06:21,210
Time's up.

1256
02:06:22,050 --> 02:06:23,880
Let's go.

1257
02:06:24,020 --> 02:06:26,250
It hasn't been an hour yet.

1258
02:06:26,390 --> 02:06:27,910
Who are you?

1259
02:06:29,020 --> 02:06:32,620
I thought you were my father.

1260
02:06:35,530 --> 02:06:37,220
Take this guy and leave.

1261
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:46,270
Now, Yuka, call him "Dad. "
We don't have much time.

1262
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:50,640
I'm back.

1263
02:06:56,150 --> 02:06:58,910
Hey, I'm back.

1264
02:07:03,460 --> 02:07:04,510
What?

1265
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:05,690
Stop.

1266
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:09,280
You're hurting me.

1267
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:38,490
Stay out of this.

1268
02:07:47,870 --> 02:07:49,890
What is this, sweetheart?

1269
02:07:52,770 --> 02:07:54,740
Stop this stupid act.

1270
02:07:57,110 --> 02:07:58,130
What?

1271
02:08:00,380 --> 02:08:03,080
Stop this stupid act.

1272
02:08:05,890 --> 02:08:10,050
I'm the customer here.
You do what I say.

1273
02:08:10,290 --> 02:08:13,590
Customer?
I was confused.

1274
02:08:14,730 --> 02:08:18,820
Sometimes, I would forget
that I was Kumiko.

1275
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:20,160
Sweetheart?

1276
02:08:20,470 --> 02:08:26,000
No, I'm Ikeda.
I have no wife or children.

1277
02:08:35,010 --> 02:08:37,780
You come with me.

1278
02:08:39,190 --> 02:08:40,210
Get up.

1279
02:09:14,750 --> 02:09:15,950
Stranger...

1280
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:22,860
Get out of here.

1281
02:09:43,350 --> 02:09:44,580
Noriko...

1282
02:09:47,150 --> 02:09:48,480
Noriko...

1283
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:50,610
I'm Mitsuko.

1284
02:09:53,730 --> 02:09:54,990
I'm Mitsuko.

1285
02:10:12,750 --> 02:10:14,110
Noriko.

1286
02:10:14,810 --> 02:10:17,340
I'm Mitsuko.

1287
02:11:04,430 --> 02:11:12,390
I felt like I was back in 2002,
standing on that platform.

1288
02:11:13,540 --> 02:11:18,000
I tore off a thread that was
dangling from my coat.

1289
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:23,380
54 girls lined up on the platform
at Shinjuku.

1290
02:11:24,650 --> 02:11:30,680
Open a window. I needed some air.

1291
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:36,890
I walked past the stranger
to the veranda.

1292
02:11:37,730 --> 02:11:42,220
I opened the window.
The white curtains billowed.

1293
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:44,590
It was snowing.

1294
02:11:45,910 --> 02:11:52,440
Saliva started to flow in my mouth.

1295
02:11:53,580 --> 02:11:56,170
It might have been drool. Cold drool.

1296
02:11:57,650 --> 02:12:01,520
I couldn't breathe,
so I opened my mouth.

1297
02:12:02,820 --> 02:12:05,220
Drool dripped on the floor.

1298
02:12:06,330 --> 02:12:11,390
The table, reflected in the window,
seemed so far away.

1299
02:12:22,410 --> 02:12:30,140
Guys from our circle were beating up the
stranger, kicking and punching him.

1300
02:12:57,380 --> 02:13:01,810
I crouched down and
touched my own drool.

1301
02:13:07,050 --> 02:13:12,180
I was drooling,
and I wanted to pee.

1302
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:21,100
Soon, everything turned white.

1303
02:13:22,330 --> 02:13:29,040
It felt like there was sand everywhere.
The floor seemed rough.

1304
02:13:30,180 --> 02:13:37,810
But I wasn't in the desert. I was in some
nameless town. I was some nameless girl.

1305
02:13:40,750 --> 02:13:44,050
And I was talking to Tangerine.

1306
02:13:44,190 --> 02:13:51,220
Tangerine, Tangerine... Round, orange-colored
Tangerine was standing in the snow.

1307
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:54,800
What's up, Norippe?

1308
02:13:57,700 --> 02:14:00,500
Boys are trouble...

1309
02:14:01,640 --> 02:14:07,170
I remembered that we used to
walk to school together.

1310
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:14,410
Recognize my uniform, Norippe?

1311
02:14:14,620 --> 02:14:17,890
That's the school I go to now.
And this is my route there

1312
02:14:18,020 --> 02:14:23,550
It was a snowy night,
and Tangerine was there.

1313
02:14:23,800 --> 02:14:26,320
I still love tangerines.

1314
02:14:30,170 --> 02:14:32,360
Tangerines.

1315
02:14:37,480 --> 02:14:38,940
Yuka was crying.

1316
02:15:22,250 --> 02:15:24,380
Mitsuko. Yoko.

1317
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:28,660
Mom.

1318
02:15:28,860 --> 02:15:31,160
I got some meat.

1319
02:15:32,230 --> 02:15:35,830
What happened?
You must be hungry.

1320
02:15:37,140 --> 02:15:39,260
Let's eat.

1321
02:15:41,570 --> 02:15:45,300
Can you go get the portable stove
from the kitchen?

1322
02:15:47,910 --> 02:15:49,280
So cold today.

1323
02:15:49,410 --> 02:15:50,900
I know.

1324
02:15:51,780 --> 02:15:53,810
Can you close the window?

1325
02:15:56,050 --> 02:15:58,520
Also, can you go get the pan?

1326
02:16:01,460 --> 02:16:04,260
My hands are numb.

1327
02:16:07,270 --> 02:16:08,200
What?

1328
02:16:08,330 --> 02:16:11,770
It doesn't work, Mom.

1329
02:16:13,740 --> 02:16:17,470
Where are extra gas cartridges?

1330
02:16:18,740 --> 02:16:20,210
He'll find them.

1331
02:16:21,410 --> 02:16:24,210
- Don't put it on the stove.
- Why not?

1332
02:16:24,580 --> 02:16:25,780
It's out of gas.

1333
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:28,890
I'll put it here for now.

1334
02:16:30,590 --> 02:16:32,960
- I'm so hungry.
- Me too.

1335
02:16:33,530 --> 02:16:36,650
Do we have extra cartridges?

1336
02:16:56,980 --> 02:17:03,480
Sweetheart, you wanted us to die together tonight.

1337
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:07,260
Didn't you?

1338
02:17:12,660 --> 02:17:13,890
Please.

1339
02:17:19,370 --> 02:17:20,900
Kill me.

1340
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:25,070
Who's this man?

1341
02:17:26,040 --> 02:17:29,010
He's your father, silly.

1342
02:17:29,380 --> 02:17:33,180
Noriko, your father's looking for
gas cartridges.

1343
02:17:34,220 --> 02:17:35,350
Noriko?

1344
02:17:36,990 --> 02:17:39,420
Kill me now.

1345
02:17:41,730 --> 02:17:47,100
Just kill me.
Then run away with Noriko and Yuka.

1346
02:17:47,230 --> 02:17:50,790
No, I'm not Noriko.
I'm Mitsuko.

1347
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:03,140
Don't make a face, Noriko.

1348
02:18:03,680 --> 02:18:04,940
No.

1349
02:18:06,020 --> 02:18:07,080
You're a girl.

1350
02:18:07,220 --> 02:18:11,920
I'm not Noriko.
I'm Mitsuko.

1351
02:18:12,060 --> 02:18:14,820
Girls shouldn't do that.

1352
02:18:15,030 --> 02:18:16,490
No.

1353
02:18:16,730 --> 02:18:17,850
Dear, don't you agree?

1354
02:18:18,930 --> 02:18:22,490
Mom, I'm Mitsuko.

1355
02:18:23,740 --> 02:18:25,900
We wanna avoid pain.

1356
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:32,010
We just wanna avoid pain, right?

1357
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:37,970
You, me...

1358
02:18:39,380 --> 02:18:42,480
We just wanna avoid pain, right?

1359
02:18:44,160 --> 02:18:47,090
We all just wanna avoid pain.

1360
02:19:04,410 --> 02:19:06,340
It's time to go, but...

1361
02:19:14,320 --> 02:19:16,340
Are we going?

1362
02:19:19,260 --> 02:19:21,020
Or staying?

1363
02:19:25,460 --> 02:19:30,230
What do you wanna do, sir?

1364
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:40,910
I'm so tired.

1365
02:19:42,680 --> 02:19:45,210
Right, sir?

1366
02:19:50,360 --> 02:19:51,820
Sir?

1367
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:07,710
Do you want more time?

1368
02:20:17,820 --> 02:20:19,440
I think...

1369
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:26,250
Can I say what I think?

1370
02:20:32,360 --> 02:20:37,230
Is it OK, Mitsuko?

1371
02:20:48,750 --> 02:20:52,810
You all look like lions to me.

1372
02:20:58,360 --> 02:21:00,450
You all look like lions.

1373
02:21:20,080 --> 02:21:22,310
Let's be rabbits again.

1374
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:33,450
Let's be rabbits again, OK?

1375
02:21:45,400 --> 02:21:52,810
I want to extend this session.

1376
02:22:02,850 --> 02:22:08,620
Let's extend it.

1377
02:22:22,540 --> 02:22:23,570
Mm, this is good.

1378
02:22:34,190 --> 02:22:34,980
Ow, hot!

1379
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:40,320
Home-cooked meals are the best.

1380
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:42,690
You have to eat vegetables too.

1381
02:22:44,630 --> 02:22:46,600
Get me some meat, Mom.

1382
02:22:49,130 --> 02:22:53,660
- Get it yourself.
- You should get it, Sis.

1383
02:22:53,810 --> 02:22:56,070
I gave you vegetables, too.

1384
02:22:56,580 --> 02:22:59,670
- Want some meat, Dad?
- No, I'm fine.

1385
02:23:02,380 --> 02:23:03,440
It's delicious.

1386
02:23:07,650 --> 02:23:08,620
Tea?

1387
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:11,350
Refill, please.

1388
02:23:12,520 --> 02:23:13,960
- Here. Yuka, you want tea?
- Please.

1389
02:23:14,660 --> 02:23:17,530
Honey, excuse me. Oh, watch out!

1390
02:23:17,860 --> 02:23:21,130
There is no Suicide Club.

1391
02:23:23,700 --> 02:23:25,260
Warms you up, huh?

1392
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:26,900
I know.

1393
02:23:29,170 --> 02:23:30,770
You can eat more, right?

1394
02:23:31,010 --> 02:23:32,810
My face is burning.

1395
02:23:34,510 --> 02:23:41,780
The world is the Suicide Club, with far
more suicides than our circle.

1396
02:23:42,620 --> 02:23:45,390
Being close to death gives living value.

1397
02:23:46,660 --> 02:23:50,090
Only a small fraction of our
members actually commit suicide.

1398
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:55,830
Not all members commit suicide?

1399
02:23:55,970 --> 02:23:59,330
It was a stupid question.

1400
02:23:59,570 --> 02:24:05,670
Only the members whose roles
require them to commit suicide, do.

1401
02:24:06,040 --> 02:24:12,350
If you saw a lion eat a zebra,
would you call it a "Cannibal Club" ?

1402
02:24:13,390 --> 02:24:17,820
Lions eat zebras.
Zebras eat grass.

1403
02:24:19,090 --> 02:24:22,650
The circle of life.

1404
02:24:35,310 --> 02:24:39,240
- Are you eating vegetables?
- Yeah, I even had seconds.

1405
02:24:39,380 --> 02:24:41,850
But there's still a lot.

1406
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:45,510
'Cause you're only eating meat Sis.

1407
02:24:47,050 --> 02:24:48,180
Sorry.

1408
02:24:51,460 --> 02:24:52,650
I want...

1409
02:24:56,490 --> 02:25:01,190
I want to start over.

1410
02:25:09,270 --> 02:25:11,830
What are you talking about?

1411
02:25:11,980 --> 02:25:13,030
Listen to me.

1412
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:16,100
Taeko.

1413
02:25:23,020 --> 02:25:26,120
I want to redo everything. Starting now.

1414
02:25:50,620 --> 02:25:51,910
But...

1415
02:25:54,050 --> 02:25:55,880
Don't you know...

1416
02:25:56,390 --> 02:26:01,850
We're all sick and tired of
your selfish ways.

1417
02:26:03,700 --> 02:26:04,860
Dad...

1418
02:26:07,370 --> 02:26:09,560
You've always been so selfish.

1419
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:12,700
Noriko.

1420
02:26:13,340 --> 02:26:18,280
She had never said anything
like that to me in Toyokawa.

1421
02:26:19,210 --> 02:26:22,870
If she had, I probably would've hit her.

1422
02:26:24,420 --> 02:26:25,710
I'm so sorry.

1423
02:26:27,220 --> 02:26:28,710
I was wrong.

1424
02:26:38,400 --> 02:26:39,360
So let's...

1425
02:26:44,940 --> 02:26:47,130
...make a fresh start.

1426
02:26:53,450 --> 02:26:56,880
Let's die once...

1427
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:02,780
...and come back to life.

1428
02:27:19,870 --> 02:27:21,460
I'm done.

1429
02:27:24,980 --> 02:27:26,100
It was delicious.

1430
02:27:26,210 --> 02:27:28,770
- I'm full.
- Me too.

1431
02:27:28,880 --> 02:27:30,470
We finished it all.

1432
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:33,080
3 hours had passed.

1433
02:27:33,950 --> 02:27:38,620
The extension on my time was about over.

1434
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:41,280
I was happy.

1435
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:50,700
I wanted to shout, "Happy!"

1436
02:27:51,900 --> 02:27:55,600
My dad...my sister...

1437
02:27:56,440 --> 02:28:00,540
...and Kumiko as my mother.

1438
02:28:07,420 --> 02:28:10,010
Happy!

1439
02:28:11,320 --> 02:28:14,490
I reminisced about...
Toyokawa, 10 years ago...

1440
02:28:15,660 --> 02:28:20,460
...the stuffed animal attached to
my sister's bag...

1441
02:28:22,430 --> 02:28:27,060
...memories...in rapid succession...

1442
02:28:31,980 --> 02:28:39,180
After dinner, my sister and l
took a bath together.

1443
02:28:39,350 --> 02:28:40,340
Sis.

1444
02:28:40,450 --> 02:28:48,660
Do you remember when Dad came to class?...
...when he was discovered by the other kids?
We talked about our past...
when we were Noriko and Yuka.

1445
02:28:52,130 --> 02:28:56,160
Yeah, I remember.
Dad was so embarrassed.

1446
02:28:59,140 --> 02:29:07,270
I couldn't tell if this woman was
Mitsuko or Noriko, but she was laughing with joy.

1447
02:29:11,250 --> 02:29:13,110
You must be tired.

1448
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:15,120
You must be too.

1449
02:29:17,060 --> 02:29:20,620
Mom, Dad.
Good night.

1450
02:29:21,330 --> 02:29:26,860
I wanted the power to go out
before we went to sleep.

1451
02:29:28,100 --> 02:29:35,530
But the whole house remained
bright with fluorescent lights.

1452
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:41,110
I'm a little dizzy from the heat.

1453
02:29:42,910 --> 02:29:44,970
Gotta get up early tomorrow, right?

1454
02:29:45,720 --> 02:29:48,120
- Gotta get some sleep.
- Me too.

1455
02:29:50,220 --> 02:29:51,310
G'night.

1456
02:29:51,520 --> 02:29:52,990
Good night.

1457
02:30:02,370 --> 02:30:11,170
I wanted to thank my father
for setting this up.

1458
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:18,310
That night, I thought I could
finally take over from my sister.

1459
02:30:19,220 --> 02:30:23,680
She had always said...

1460
02:30:24,660 --> 02:30:30,030
"Gotta go somewhere different.
Gotta get out of here. "

1461
02:30:30,930 --> 02:30:34,300
I had laughed at her.

1462
02:30:34,970 --> 02:30:40,700
But I finally understood her.

1463
02:30:46,640 --> 02:30:52,810
I watched her sleep
for the first time in a long time.

1464
02:30:53,750 --> 02:30:56,480
She was moaning in her sleep.

1465
02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:03,060
Sounded familiar.
I was happy.

1466
02:31:03,830 --> 02:31:08,960
I wanted to tell her,
"Never stop acting, even in your sleep. "

1467
02:31:09,430 --> 02:31:12,030
I'm sorry, Sis.

1468
02:31:29,950 --> 02:31:34,720
Then I quietly got out of bed.

1469
02:31:35,630 --> 02:31:39,360
Tiptoed down the hall.

1470
02:31:40,970 --> 02:31:43,490
Something I wanted to see.

1471
02:31:49,670 --> 02:31:54,540
Grinding his teeth...
talking in his sleep...as usual.

1472
02:31:55,850 --> 02:31:58,910
Thank you, Dad.

1473
02:32:39,090 --> 02:32:44,320
While I was putting on my shoes,
I almost sneezed.

1474
02:32:45,530 --> 02:32:46,790
I held it in.

1475
02:33:06,050 --> 02:33:12,180
I opened the door and went outside.
Fresh air greeted me.

1476
02:33:14,060 --> 02:33:18,190
6 AM. It was still dark.

1477
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:26,160
I took a deep breath.
I inhaled deeply.

1478
02:34:16,020 --> 02:34:21,860
I started to walk down the street
toward the center of the city.

1479
02:34:22,730 --> 02:34:28,890
I wanted to go somewhere
completely different.

1480
02:34:30,530 --> 02:34:31,870
I sneezed.

1481
02:34:36,810 --> 02:34:42,770
I'm walking for the first time.

1482
02:34:44,320 --> 02:34:49,510
I was through with Yoko.
But I wasn't Yuka either.

1483
02:34:50,720 --> 02:34:55,280
Just some nameless girl.
I started walking.

1484
02:35:51,050 --> 02:35:58,180
Your heart is a small glass.
If you pour too much emotion into it...

1485
02:35:59,220 --> 02:36:02,320
...tears will spill out.

1486
02:36:04,930 --> 02:36:07,160
Goodbye, Yuka.

1487
02:36:09,270 --> 02:36:12,670
Goodbye, my adolescence.

1488
02:36:13,270 --> 02:36:16,600
Goodbye, Haikyo. com.

1489
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:20,500
Goodbye, Mitsuko.

1490
02:36:24,420 --> 02:36:26,110
I am Noriko.

1491
02:39:00,970 --> 02:39:08,310
